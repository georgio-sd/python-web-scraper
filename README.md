# Indeed web scraper (with BeautifulSoup library)
This python script scrapes unique jobs from indeed.com and puts them into MySQL DB.
It saves job seekers' time because they don't need to read repetitive offers. 
* indeed-scraper.py - backend script, loads job offers to the database
* index.py - frontend script, user interface
* update.py - frontend script, marks job offers as applied, not interested or will check later
* database-table - MySQL (MirandaDB) database structure
